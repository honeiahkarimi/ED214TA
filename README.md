# ED 214B Labs

Welcome to the repository for ED 214B Labs! This repository contains labs written in R for the course ED 214B, where I serve as the Teaching Assistant.

The primary purpose of 214B, the second course in this sequence, is to build upon the foundational concepts introduced in 214A and continue to foster competence with quantitatively oriented social scientific research. We will focus in particular on linear regression models, which are at the heart of the most commonly-employed statistical models in the human sciences; attaining a deep understanding of regression gives a researcher a powerful and flexible set of tools that can be used to test a wide range ofhypotheses. Furthermore, understanding regression helps demystify the relationships between what might initially seem like unrelated statistical techniques. In this course, t-tests, ANOVA, and ANCOVA will be presented as special cases of multiple linear regression.
